```
The project structure consists of multiple C files, each representing an exercise or an example of a bug, and a `README.md` file for documentation purposes.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/0x03-C-Debugging.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd 0x03-C-Debugging
   ```

3. Compile the desired exercise file using gcc. For example, to compile `exercise_1.c`, run the following command:
   ```
   gcc exercise_1.c -o exercise_1
   ```

4. Run the compiled executable:
   ```
   ./exercise_1
   ```

5. Observe the program's output and analyze any issues or bugs present in the code.

## Exercises
