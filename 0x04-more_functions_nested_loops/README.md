# 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops

## Description
This repository contains solutions to programming exercises in the C language focusing on functions and nested loops. The exercises in this collection build upon the concepts covered in the previous repository (0x02. C - Functions, nested loops) and provide further practice and understanding.

## Requirements
To compile and run the C programs in this repository, you need to have a C compiler installed on your system. The recommended compiler is [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/), which is available for multiple platforms.

## Project Structure
```
├── exercise_1.c
├── exercise_2.c
├── exercise_3.c
├── ...
├── exercise_n.c
└── README.md
```
The project structure consists of multiple C files, each representing an exercise, and a `README.md` file for documentation purposes.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/0x04-C-More-functions-more-nested-loops.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd 0x04-C-More-functions-more-nested-loops
   ```

3. Compile the desired exercise file using gcc. For example, to compile `exercise_1.c`, run the following command:
   ```
   gcc exercise_1.c -o exercise_1
   ```

4. Run the compiled executable:
   ```
   ./exercise_1
   ```

5. Follow the instructions provided in each exercise and observe the program's output.

## Exercises
The following exercises are included in this repository:

1. **exercise_1.c**: Write a function that prints the multiplication table of a given number.

2. **exercise_2.c**: Write a function that checks if a number is prime.

3. **exercise_3.c**: Write a function that prints a triangle of a specified size using the `#` character.

4. **...**: (Add descriptions of additional exercises)

Feel free to explore and solve the exercises in the order you prefer.
