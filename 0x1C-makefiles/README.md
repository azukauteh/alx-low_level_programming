Welcome to the **0x1C. C - Makefiles** repository! This repository contains projects and exercises related to using Makefiles in the context of C programming. Makefiles are essential tools for automating the build process of C programs, allowing you to efficiently manage dependencies, compile code, and create executable files.

## Project Descriptions

Here's a brief overview of the projects included in this repository:

1. **0-Makefile**: An initial introduction to Makefiles. This project demonstrates the basic structure of a Makefile and how to use it to compile a C program.

2. **1-Makefile**: Building on the first project, this exercise covers more advanced Makefile concepts. It demonstrates how to use variables, rules, and includes in a Makefile.

3. **2-Makefile**: This project delves into pattern rules and how they can simplify the Makefile by automating the compilation process for multiple source files.

4. **3-Makefile**: In this project, you will work with library archives. You'll learn how to create and use static libraries in your C projects.

5. **4-Makefile**: The final project in this series focuses on dynamic libraries. You'll explore the creation and usage of shared libraries in C programming.

## Getting Started

To get started with the projects in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/azukauteh/alx-low_level_programming.git
```

2. **Navigate to Project Directory**: Change your working directory to the specific project you want to explore.

```bash
cd 0x1C-C-Makefiles
```

3. **Compile the Code**: Use the provided Makefile to compile the C code. Simply run the `make` command.

```bash
make
```

4. **Run the Executable**: Once the compilation is successful, run the generated executable.

```bash
./output
```

## Usage

Each project directory contains a README.md file that provides specific instructions and details about the project. Make sure to read the README associated with the project you are working on.

The Makefiles included in each project directory are pre-configured to handle the compilation process for the corresponding project. You can modify these Makefiles to suit your needs or to experiment with different build configurations.
