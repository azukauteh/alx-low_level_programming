The project structure consists of multiple C files, each representing an exercise, and a `README.md` file for documentation purposes.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd 0x01-C-Variables-if-else-while
   ```

3. Compile the desired exercise file using gcc. For example, to compile `exercise_1.c`, run the following command:
   ```
   gcc exercise_1.c -o exercise_1
   ```

4. Run the compiled executable:
   ```
   ./exercise_1
   ```

5. Follow the instructions provided in each exercise and observe the program's output.

## Exercises
The following exercises are included in this directory:

1. **exercise_1.c**: Write a program that prints "Hello, Holberton" to the standard output.

2. **exercise_2.c**: Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

3. **exercise_3.c**: Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, except for the letters 'q' and 'e', followed by a new line.

4. **...**: (Add descriptions of additional exercises)

Feel free to explore and solve the exercises in the order you prefer.
