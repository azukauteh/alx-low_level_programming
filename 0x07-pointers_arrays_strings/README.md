# 0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings


## Description
This directory contains solutions to programming exercises in the C language focusing on advanced topics related to pointers, arrays, and strings. The exercises in this collection build upon the concepts covered in the previous repositories (0x05. C - Pointers, arrays, and strings and 0x06. C - More pointers, arrays, and strings) and provide further practice and understanding.

└── README.md
```
The project structure consists of multiple C files, each representing an exercise, and a `README.md` file for documentation purposes.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/0x07-C-Even-more-pointers-arrays-strings.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd 0x07-C-Even-more-pointers-arrays-strings
   ```

3. Compile the desired exercise file using gcc. For example, to compile `exercise_1.c`, run the following command:
   ```
   gcc exercise_1.c -o exercise_1
   ```

4. Run the compiled executable:
   ```
   ./exercise_1
   ```

5. Follow the instructions provided in each exercise and observe the program's output.

## Exercises
